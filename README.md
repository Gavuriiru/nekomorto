# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` now runs frontend + backend together in same-origin mode at `http://localhost:8080`.
In production, CORS accepts only configured allowlist origins. Requests without `Origin` are allowed only for `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`.

Quality checks:

```sh
# Lint (Biome)
npm run lint

# Format
npm run format

# Tests
npm run test
```

Optional debug commands:

```sh
# Backend only (same integrated server process)
npm run dev:server

# Frontend-only Vite server (diagnostic mode)
npm run dev:client
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## How can I deploy this project?

Build and run the integrated server:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

`npm run start` expects `dist/index.html` to exist (generated by `npm run build`).

## Vercel Preview (Frontend only)

Use this mode when the API stays outside Vercel and only the React app is deployed on Vercel.

Set these Vercel env vars:

```sh
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.your-domain.com
VITE_ASSET_BASE=https://api.your-domain.com
```

Notes:
- `VITE_API_BASE` should point to your external backend base URL.
- `VITE_ASSET_BASE` should point to where `/uploads/...` is served (usually same backend).
- Keep backend secrets out of Vercel in this mode.
- Add your Vercel preview domain to backend CORS allowlist via `ADMIN_ORIGINS`.

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes, you can!

To connect a domain, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain.
