## 2025-02-28 - React.memo for recursive list rendering
**Learning:** In React, recursive rendering of lists (like nested comment trees) using inline functions (`renderComment`) causes unnecessary re-renders of the entire tree when state changes (like typing in a form input).
**Action:** Extract recursive render functions into standalone components wrapped in `React.memo`, and ensure props like event handlers are memoized with `useCallback`. This significantly reduces React reconciliation overhead.
